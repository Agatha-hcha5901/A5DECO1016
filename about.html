<h1><strong>WHAT WE DO</strong></h1>

<h3>DISASTERS RELIEF</h3>

      </figure>
<p>Every year, natural disasters destroy local economies and devastate lives. They cause Americans emotional damage and cost $24.4 billion in insured losses each year.

Earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, droughts, floods, and other natural disasters pose a great threat to our country. We’re here to help – in any given year, we provide nearly 800,000 survivors with support, hope, and healing.</p>

<h3>FOOD SHORTAGE</h3>

      <p>An additional 6.9 million families live on the verge of food insecurity. That means they don’t always know where their next meal is coming from. During the pandemic, the number sky-rocket.</P>

      <h3>RESCUE CHRISTMAS</h3>

        <figcaption>This year, the need is greater than ever</figcaption>

      <p>This holiday season, The Salvation Army expects to see a greater need for our services – more than any in recent history.
Unemployment rates are expected to be 10%-11%, and based on the increased service we’ve already provided this year due to COVID-19, we need resources to serve up to 155% more people with Christmas assistance. </p>
